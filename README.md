# NearbyApp
A route/trip planner CRUD app frontend. Users can explore a map of an area, save locations of interest, save a group nearby locations to saved locations, plot a route on the map between two locations and save it, and save a group of nearby routes that are close to a specific saved location

The Problem:  
Imagine you've lived downtown in a city for years, and everything important to you is close by ‚Äî the gym, grocery store, office, kids' school, etc.
Then you get a fantastic job offer‚Ä¶ in a new city you don‚Äôt know well.
How do you quickly find a neighborhood that‚Äôs just as convenient?  
Or...  
You're planning a trip to a new city.
You want to visit all the best historical sites and restaurants ‚Äî ideally close to each other.
How do you plan this efficiently without jumping between multiple tabs?

The Solution:  
To solve this, I built The Nearby App ‚Äî a route and trip planner designed to:

üîç Find and log places of interest  
üó∫Ô∏è Group locations by proximity  
üìç Calculate and save routes  
üóÇÔ∏è Organize plans around a central location  

Yes, technically you could do this with Google Maps ‚Äî but having tried that myself during a move, I found the experience clunky and not built for this specific use case.

# How To Use

This is a route planner. It can be used for various applications, but the core idea is that it is for when you need to keep a record of all the significant places near you and how far they are so you can easily plan trips to multiple places at once before starting a trip. For example, if you want to move to a new home but you want to keep a record of all the close by amenities, like grocery stores, gyms, malls, or restaurants, before going for a viewing. With this web app, you can search for all the places close to a given location and record them. This information can be used to quickly narrow down your list of prospective homes so you don't have to waste time going for viewings at homes that don't have the desired amenities. A more simple example could be for moving companies to plan or companies that deliver goods to multiple locations to plan trips beforehand. You can also check the general distance between places.

You can save a list of routes or a list of places. You can then select a place from the list and add nearby places to it. You can also add multiple nearby routes to each place.

## Find General Route

The most simple feature is being able to check the route of two points on the map. You can do this when you click on the route button. When the route panel is open, you can click two points of the map to find their distance information.
